# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Repository

Welcome to the Algorithms Repository! Here you'll find a collection of classic algorithms implemented in C and C++. Each algorithm is meticulously crafted and contained in its own directory, along with detailed explanations and examples.

## Algorithms

- [Bubble Sort](BubbleSort/main.cpp)
- [Dijkstra's Algorithm](DijkstrasAlgorithm/main.c)
- [Floyd-Warshall Algorithm](Floyd-Warshall_Algorithm/main.c)
- [Knapsack Problem](KnapsackProblem/main.c)
- [Kruskal's Algorithm](KruskalsAlgorithm/main.c)
- [Merge Sort](MergeSort/main.cpp)
- [Pascal's Triangle](PascalTriangle/main.c)
- [Prim's Algorithm](PrimsAlgorithm/main.c)
- [Warshall's Algorithm](Warshall-Algorithm/main.c)
- [Warshall's Algorithm with Matrix Input Version](Warshall-Algorithm/MatrixInput-Version/main.c)

## Games

- [Hangman](Games/Hangman/main.c)
- [Tic Tac Toe](Games/TicTacToe/main.c)
- [Queen's Puzzle](Games/QueensPuzzle/main.c)

## Theoretical / Other

- ### It's often used in theoretical computer science during proofs as a stand-in for Turing machines due to it's more familiar syntax
  - [URM](URM/main.c)

## Running the Code

Each algorithm comes with its own executable file, allowing you to see the algorithm in action. Simply navigate to the respective directory and run the executable.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you have any ideas or improvements, feel free to open an issue to discuss them before making a pull request.
