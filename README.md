# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Repository

Welcome to the Algorithms Repository! Here you'll find a collection of classic algorithms implemented in C and C++. Each algorithm is meticulously crafted and contained in its own directory, along with detailed explanations and examples.

## Algorithms Included

- **Bubble Sort:** Sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
- **Knapsack Problem:** Solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Constructs the minimum spanning tree of a graph by adding edges in increasing order of weight.
- **Merge Sort:** Divides the array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Pascal's Triangle:** Generates Pascal's Triangle, showcasing both iterative and recursive approaches.
- **Prim's Algorithm:** Builds the minimum spanning tree of a graph by adding edges in increasing order of weight from a single source vertex.
- **Warshall's Algorithm:** Computes the transitive closure of a directed graph using dynamic programming.

## Running the Code

Each algorithm comes with its own executable file, allowing you to see the algorithm in action. Simply navigate to the respective directory and run the executable.
